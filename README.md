# Pern Todo List

## General info
This project is a simple todo list using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Nodejs). It was a personal project to practice using the pg library and to refresh React skills.

## Setup
To run this project, first install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../pern_todo
$ npm install
```
You will then have to start the back-end server in the server folder:

```
$ cd ./server
$ node index.js
```

Then you can start the client-end server in the client folder:

```
$ cd ../client
$ npm start
```
